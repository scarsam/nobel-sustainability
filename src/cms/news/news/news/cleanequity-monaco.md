  Prince Albert revealed the new Award for Sustainability with the Nobel
  Sustainability Trust and a Global Green Investment Bank, at the CleanEquity
  Monaco conference last Friday at the Fairmont Monte Carlo.\

  Referring to CleanEquity Monaco, which he co-founded with Mungo Park, Chairman
  of Innovator Capital, in 2007, the Sovereign Prince said he was proud that
  “the conference has become an important part of the sustainability landscape.
  Over the years, some 300 companies have presented their plans to over 1600
  attendees.\

  “These companies have gone on to raise nearly $2 billion, friendships have
  been forged, and greater strides have been made towards a cleaner, safer and
  more sustainable future.”


  The Prince then announced “a new initiative that has origins in the
  multidisciplinary nature of CleanEquity Monaco, the creation of a new Global
  Award for Sustainability and a Global Green Investment Bank.”\

  As HSH stated, the Nobel Prizes continue to be recognised as some of the
  world’s greatest accolades. “Sustainability was a key concept for the three
  Nobel brothers Alfred, Ludwig and Robert. It has now become a vital part of
  our modern lives; but the concept was not included in Alfred’s will. So,
  because the Nobel Foundation cannot add to its portfolio of prizes, four Nobel
  family members, in agreement with the Foundation, formed the Nobel
  Sustainability Trust to promote sustainability in modern life.\

  “The trust’s mission is to sustain quality of life in the face of threats –
  pollution, climate change – and to create the Award for Sustainability.”\

  Monaco will host the Sustainability Award Ceremony in 2020 or 2021.\

  Back in 2012, the Nobel Sustainability Trust co-hosted CleanEquity Monaco and
  engaged Innovator Capital to develop the Nobel Sustainability Fund, the
  world’s first multi-phase, multi-technology, multi-geography sustainable
  technology fund. It was launched in June 2016, by Earth Capital Partners and
  was seeded by the Monaco Reserve Fund.


  Mungo Park added, “We are creating a multi-sovereign backed Global Green
  Investment Bank and other nations are waiting to participate as soon as the
  corporate structure is in place.”\

  Mr Park explained that the investment bank “will provide a service to
  technology companies and specifically, will not compete with the investment
  community”.\

  “Quite the opposite,” he assured. “In fact, its model will be to help
  companies become investor-ready, bridge financing at a fair and reasonable
  margin above the investment bank’s cost of money, and will enable companies to
  strengthen their boards, their management teams, their documentation and their
  intellectual property portfolios.”


  Chairman of the Nobel Sustainability Trust, Professor Michael Nobel,
  commented, “The official recognition of the award and the Nobel Sustainability
  Trust foundation expressed during this CleanEquity Monaco conference is of
  outmost importance, both to the organisation and myself. The tremendous value
  of such a recognition being confirmed by a world-renown expert in the field
  like HSH Prince Albert in a plenary session of a meeting of this type cannot
  be underestimated.”


  Professor Nobel went on to say, “The issue of sustainability has in recent
  years become vitally important for mankind’s wellbeing and even chances of
  long term survival. It goes far beyond what was thought necessary or important
  in earlier times. This is also why it has become so important that all of
  humanity, and not only special interest groups, recognises that sustainability
  policies needs to become and remain an integral part of our activities in
  order for us to prosper. Actions and words by recognised world leaders in the
  field, like Prince Albert, help create and reinforce such beliefs.”\

  Following the groundbreaking announcements, Prince Albert, who will celebrate
  his 60th birthday on Wednesday March, 14, presented the three CleanEquity
  Awards, designed this year by American conceptual artist Darren Bader.\

  The awards winners were: Superdielectrics for Excellence in the Field of
  Environmental Technology Research; NanoSpun for Excellence in the Field of
  Environmental Technology Development; and BBOXX for Excellence in the Field of
  Environmental Technology Commercialisation.\

  Over the two days, twenty-seven companies presented at the 11th edition of the
  invitation-only CleanEquity Monaco.\

  “It’s the people assembled in this room that help turn science fiction into
  science fact,” said Prince Albert and their clean technologies are testament
  to his long-standing commitment for the Principality to be a model green
  country, which respects the natural environment and subscribes to be carbon
  neutral by 2050.\
