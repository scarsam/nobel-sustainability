  LONDON (Reuters) – Members of Sweden’s Nobel family, best known for the prizes
  bearing their name, and the billionaire co-founder of Hargreaves Lansdown are
  backing a venture capital fund to invest in “sustainable” technology,
  manufacturing and service companies in Britain.


  Monday’s launch comes days after Britain announced measures to develop growth
  companies, seeking to boost private and public investment by 20 billion
  pounds.


  The Nobel Sustainability Growth Fund is being launched by Sustainable
  Technology Investors Ltd (STIL) in partnership with the Nobel Sustainability
  Trust (NST), which was founded by members of the Nobel family to respond to
  climate change.


  NST has lent its name in return for a slice of the profit. Initial backing of
  10 million pounds ($13.3 million) will be provided by SET3, the investment
  group founded by Gordon Power and Stephen Lansdown, and Monaco’s sovereign
  wealth fund. The fund aims to grow to 100 million pounds and make 10-12
  investments of between 3 and 10 million pounds.


  “The UK continues to offer a strong pipeline of investments post Brexit,” STIL
  managing partner Jim Totty said.


  The fund will be followed by other regional ones focused on resource
  efficiency, clean energy and sustainable technology.
