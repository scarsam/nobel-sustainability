    NST is a Swiss foundation, established in 2007 by four members of the Nobel
    family. Formerly known as the Nobel Charitable Trust, its name was changed
    to the Nobel Sustainability Trust in 2011 so as to represent its role and
    activities more accurately. To promote the activities described above NST
    will encourage research, development, action and implementation of
    sustainable solutions. A key component will be the creation of an Award for
    Sustainability. This award, given annually, will be an accolade for those
    who make outstanding contributions to sustainability.

    The winners will be presented with the award at a gala dinner held in
    connection with a symposium, organised by NST, in major cities around the
    world. NST, via its secretariat in Switzerland and its representative
    offices in Sweden and Costa Rica, will assist in the selection of
    universities from various countries, which will collect the proposed
    projects and candidates. One of these will also be the Award Coordinating
    University (the “ACU”), this centre, in consultation with NST, will select
    and maintain the list of sourcing universities. The ACU will form a
    committee, the Sustainability Award Committee, which will have final say in
    the selection of the award winners. This comittee will have members from
    outside the ACU. NST will plan and manage the annual conferences and related
    events.


    This comittee will have members from outside the ACU. NST will plan and
    manage the annual conferences and related events. It will liaise with the
    media and issue invitations for the award ceremonies. Stringent efforts will
    be made to ensure that the NST Awards will be recognised, by all concerned,
    as being independent of the traditional Nobel Prizes. NST’s financial
    support will come from sovereign entities, family offices and corporations
    who support its agenda. A clear understanding of the origin of these funds
    is essential, so NST will work with licensed and registered entities, which
    are regulated by the financial authorities in their respective
    jurisdictions.


    Funding has begun and success has already been achieved. In 2016, Innovator
    Capital (ICL) a specialist investment bank in London, facilitated the
    creation of the Nobel Sustainability Fund® (NSF). The fund, seeded by the
    Constitutional Reserve Fund of Monaco, with the support of H.S.H. Prince
    Albert II of Monaco and Stephen Lansdown, co-founder of Hargreaves Lansdown,
    is a multi-geography fund, managed by Earth Capital Partners (ECP),
    subsidiary of the SET3 organisation, which accelerates the development and
    growth of sustainable technology companies.

    The Nobel family, founders of the Nobel Sustainability Trust (“NST”) have,
    with great concern, been observing the devastation of the world’s vital,
    natural and non-renewable resources. This overconsumption has led to an
    increase in global temperatures and pollution of land, food, water and air.
    The founders believe that the economic and social health of civilisation
    will, to a large extent, depend on the availability of energy and a
    sustainable approach to agriculture, forestry, industrial manufacturing and
    water reclamation. This will require substantial intellectual and financial
    effort. It is the aim of NST to assist with this process. The objective of
    NST is to improve quality of life, which is, today, threatened by pollution,
    climate change and depletion of natural resources. Sufficient food, water,
    air and energy, in clean conditions, is essential to reaching this
    objective.

    **NST aims to contribute in the following areas:**

    * Climate change with emphasis on reduction of global warming;
    * Advances in clean and renewable technologies and policies;
    * A pollution-free, life-sustaining environment;
    * Inspiration for present and future generations
