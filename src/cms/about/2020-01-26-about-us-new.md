    NST is a Swiss foundation, established in 2007 by four members of the Nobel
    family. Formerly known as the Nobel Charitable Trust, its name was changed
    to the Nobel Sustainability Trust in 2011 so as to more accurately represent
    its role and activities. Its board of trustees today includes five members
    of the Nobel Family.


    To promote the activities described above, NST encourages research,
    development, action and implementation of sustainable solutions. A key
    component will be the creation of Awards for Sustainability. These awards,
    given annually, will form an accolade for those who make outstanding
    contributions to sustainability. The winners will be presented with the
    awards at a dinner held in connection with a symposium, organised by NST, in
    major cities around the world.

    NST, via its secretariat and main office in Switzerland and its
    representative offices in Sweden, Pakistan, Japan and Costa Rica, will
    assist in the selection of universities from various countries, which will
    collect the proposed projects and candidates. One of these will also be the
    Award Coordinating Entity (“ACE”), This entity, in consultation with NST,
    will select and maintain the list of sourcing universities. The ACE will
    create a committee, the Sustainability Award Committee, which will have
    final say in the selection of the award winners. This body will include
    members from various academic institutions. NST's different offices will
    plan and manage the annual conferences and related events. It will liaise
    with the media and organise and propose invitations for the award
    ceremonies.


    Stringent efforts will be made to ensure that the NST Awards will be
    recognised, by all concerned, as being independent of the traditional Nobel
    Prizes and that no administrative or commercial relations exist between the
    Nobel Foundation and NST.


    NST’s financial support will come from sovereign entities, family offices
    and corporations who support its agenda. A clear understanding of the origin
    of these funds is essential, so NST will work with licensed and registered
    entities, which are regulated by the financial authorities in their
    respective jurisdictions.

  column1: >-
    The members of the Nobel family, founders of the Nobel Sustainability Trust
    (“NST”) have, with great concern, been observing the devastation of the
    world’s vital, natural and non-renewable resources. This overconsumption has
    led to an increase in global temperatures and pollution of land, food, water
    and air. The founders believe that the economic and social health of
    civilisation will, to a large extent, depend on the availability of energy
    and a sustainable approach to agriculture, forestry, industrial
    manufacturing and water reclamation. This will require substantial
    intellectual and financial effort. It is the aim of NST to assist with this
    process. The objective of NST is to improve quality of life, which is,
    today, threatened by pollution, climate change and depletion of natural
    resources. Sufficient food, water, air and energy, in clean conditions, is
    essential to reaching this objective.

    **NST aims to contribute in the following areas:**

    * Climate change with emphasis on reduction of global warming;
    * Advances in clean and renewable technologies and policies;
    * A pollution-free, life-sustaining environment;
    * Inspiration for present and future generations

        Global Brand Ambassador. He has a background in entrepreneurship, brand
        development and in the automobile and food & beverages industry. In his

        and talent development within the field, securing a better future.

        with various governments and their respective collaborative financial
        institutions - hence engaging all strategic partners - the aim is to
        make the NST Awards an event in a world wide setting through a 10 year
        plan.


        Several initiatives need to be put into work *now*. In order to connect
        NST more closely with citizens, businesses and organizations, NST has
        appointed Kristian Vangsgaard as head of the initiative, providing him
        with the necessary means to make NST a more commercialized and modern
        organization. Looking forward, the NST will appear in an increasing
        amount of new arenas such as a social networks, education platforms,
        mastermind events for exclusive small groups of 20 participants and
        several more areas.
